# Gorch - Go Service Orchestrator

Gorch, short for Go Orchestrator, is a robust library built to manage the lifecycle of services in your Go applications seamlessly. Whether utilizing a microservices architecture or ordering an array of services within a monolithic application, Gorch provides an efficient, standardized way of starting, managing, and gracefully shutting down services.

## Features
- **Structured Service Management**: Gorch introduces structure to how services are managed, providing consistent start and stop procedures.

- **Automatic Error Handling**: Gorch monitors services and triggers graceful shutdowns if a service encounters a critical error, preventing system-wide crashes.

- **Ease of use**: With Gorch, infrastructure management is abstracted away, allowing developers to focus on the core functionality of their services.

## Code Analysis & Examples

Gorch operates on two primary structures: `Gorch` and `Launcher`. 

- `Gorch`: Maintains the context, a slice of launchers (services to be managed), and an error channel. 

- `Launcher`: Executes the start and stop functions of the services, handling errors and responding to context cancellations.

You can initialize Gorch and register services as shown below:

```go
func main() {
    gorch := gorch.New(context.Background())
    gorch.Register(yourService)

    if err := gorch.Run(); err != nil {
        // One of the registered services
        // has stopped with error
    }
}
```

In this example, yourService should implement either or both of the launcher.Starter and launcher.Stopper interfaces.

Upon calling gorch.Run(), Gorch initiates each registered service in a separate goroutine. It then listens for errors or context cancellation, responding appropriately.

Each registered service should have Start() and/or Stop() methods corresponding to the launcher.Starter and launcher.Stopper interfaces respectively. If any of these methods is missing, it won't be called, providing flexibility in how services are managed.

For example, your service may look like:
```go
type YourService struct {
    // Your service implementation
}

func (s *YourService) Start(ctx context.Context) error {
    // Your start logic
}

func (s *YourService) Stop(ctx context.Context) error {
    // Your graceful shutdown logic
}
```

Leverage Gorch to simplify and standardize your service management and to bring reliability to your Go applications.
